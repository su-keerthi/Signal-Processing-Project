# Signal Processing Project

## Overview

Within this project two separate problem statements were taken up. 

1) The first problem is realted to non ideal sampling conditions that are faced practically. Under this two different sceanrios were considered. 
a. Sampling doesnt take place at every integer instant, but there is some small delay. This delay is known but random.
b. The sampling instant has no error, but the sample may be missing with a certain probability.
For both these scenarios a method was developed to estimate the originial signal with least minimal error.

2) The second problem required analysis of 4 different audio files of drum beats. The objective was to identify the time stamps of the hits as well as the type of the drum
